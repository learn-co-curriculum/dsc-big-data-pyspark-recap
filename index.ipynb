    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Big Data usually refers to datasets that grow so large that they become awkward to work with using traditional database management systems and analytical approaches\n",
    "* Big data refers to data that is terabytes (TB) to petabytes (PB) in size\n",
    "* MapReduce can be used to split big datasets up in smaller sets to be distributed over several machines to deal with Big Data Analytics \n",
    "* PySpark can be installed directly on your computer using `conda` or in a Docker container\n",
    "* When you start working with PySpark, you have to create a `SparkContext` or `SparkSession`\n",
    "* The creation or RDDs is essential when working with PySpark\n",
    "* Examples of actions and transformations include `collect()`, `count()`, `filter()`, `first()`, `take()`, and `reduce()` \n",
    "* Machine Learning on the scale of big data can be done with Spark using the `ml` library\n"
